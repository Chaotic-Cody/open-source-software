## Checkpoint 3 - Curate Some Data

While the accuracy of the test was only 33%, the image I classified as a "pullover" could also be classified as a coat. On the other hand, the ankle boot was completely misclassified. The original testing model of 10000 images only had an accuracy of ~88%, meaning 1200 images were misclassified. With a sample size as small as 3, it is completely possible that this test is still within the acceptable error range. That being said, curating more images is outside of the scope of this lab.
