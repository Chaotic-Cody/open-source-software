## Part 0 - Documentation

### Areas of interest
There are many areas I would like to explore, including the development of:
1. Game development tools
2. General workflow tools
3. LED lighting programming tools

In particular, some established projects I'm looking to get involved in include:
1. Apache OpenOffice
2. Aurora
3. Nevermore Engine

and I would like to potentially work on a project to add support for the programming of RGB LEDS in Corsair's keyboards using a lightweight scripting language - namely, Lua.

Each of these projects interests me for a different reason. 

In my spare time, I'm a hobbyist game developer and would love to make tools to allow games to be made more organized and their execution more effective. 

I use Apache OpenOffice as an alternative to Microsoft's paid Office suite, and would love to give back by updating it to be more competitive. 

I recently purchased a new Corsair K95 RGB Platinum keyboard for the new PC I've just built, and was very disappointed by the lack of customization their software allowed for controlling the LEDs.
