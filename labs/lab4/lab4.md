## 2. The Importance of Licensing
There are many reasons why it is important not only to choose a license for your project, but to pick one that properly outlines how you wish to see your project used in the future. Licenses outline what can be done with your creation, including who can use, distribute, and even work on it, and to the extent of which the user can do so. Whether your creation is for private use or completely open source, it's important to choose the correct license.

In particular, without a license you have little to no chance of building a community to work on your project!

## 3. The Dangers of Unlicensed Projects
You should never use, nor contribute, to projects that do not have a license. In most areas, content without an explicit license automatically means that the rights to all said content are help exclusively by the original creator. This includes any work contributed by others, and can mean especially bad legal trouble if the owner decides to take action against the users. Anything built using the original assets is also at the whim of the original owner, who can issue a DMCA takedown notice, and potentially sue for monetary damages if you've made anything from their assets.

## 4. Why the Web beat Gopher - Failure to follow the Open System Model
I agree with the authors reasoning. The open systems model includes open communications standards and open source software. The former is important to garner increasing mind share and wider adoption in the target demographic, whereas the latter is important for the actual development of the software to keep it constantly evolving and better than its competitors. The developers of Gopher, following a closed source model and using very little user input in their decision making process, shunted their own growth. Once people got wind of the potential for the software to be sold via licensing, the search for an alternative begun, making way for the rise of the World Wide Web and HTML.

## 5. GPL v2
Linux uses the GPL v2 license. The GPL v2 license is a free software license. This license not only allows the user to run, study, distribute modified versions, and redistribute the source code freely, but also requires that any modifications or usage in future projects utilizing the GPL licensed project be made available under the same GPL license. Linux is an open source operating system begun by Linus Torvalds, and is one of the most useful and popular pieces of open source software known today. It has been forked countless times, with individual distributions gaining popularity in their own circles.

## 6. Example project as a !group! (my quick example - Web Edit. Allows you to easily edit webpages locally and retain a copy with your edits. Example usage would be to highlight text in an article, or to easily mockup website design changes for the website's designer to use as feedback. If the webpage is updated, a diff can be run between your original local version and the new version, and you can decide from there how to merge them. )

## 7. GPl, LGPL, Apache 2.0, and BSD
GPL and LGPL are both completely open source. The main difference between GPL and LGPL is that GPL is more of a copyleft license, where everything contributed to a GPL licensed project must also fall under the GPL license, whereas the LGPL license is more permissive, and allows contributors to link and use non-free modules. Any modifications made to the LGPL code must still be made public to everyone under the LGPL license, however! The Apache 2.0 license is permissive, but every change requires the contributor to add prominent notifications stating how and what they've modified. 

Best for developer - Apache 2.0

Best for company - LGPL

Best for common good - GPL

########## Intermediate - create repo and choose license

## 9. Choosing a project
I have so many ideas for potential projects to work on. For this course in particular, I'm either going to work on a large, existing project with a flourishing community to learn how to work on a project at scale, or I am going to begin my own project from scratch to learn how to build my own community and codebase from the ground up. In the case of the large codebase, I would like to work on Apache's OpenOffice suite. I've used OpenOffice as a substitute for Microsoft Office for a long time now, and would love a chance to give back to the community. The project has a huge demographic. For example, I started to use OpenOffice when I was in high school, but anyone needing a powerful word processor, powerpoint maker, or spreadsheet program for free will want to pick up a distribution of OpenOffice. Of course, for this project I would need to maintain Apache's license V2.0.

For my own project, I would most likely utilize the GPL license, as it allows people to build off of my code base and for everyone to benefit from any contributions.
